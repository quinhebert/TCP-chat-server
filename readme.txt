Open a new terminal at the project folder and start the server using the following command:
'python3 server.py'

Start a client by opening another terminal at the folder and use the following command:
'python3 client.py'

You can interact with the client by entering a name and then simply type your message and press enter.
If you type a message and press enter it will be sent to everyone. 
You can send a direct message by typing '<username>::<message>', so if I wanted to send a message to a user with the name Bob,
I would type 'Bob::this is my message'; This message will be broadcasted from the server only to Bob.

Demo images will be provided in my attached report.
